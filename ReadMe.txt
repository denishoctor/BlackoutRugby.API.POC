This is currently a simple Proof of Concept App for using the Blackout Rugby API. 

I'm keen for anyone who has an interest in Blackout Rugby and/or HTML5 and all that has come to encompass that term to get involved! 

Currently it's built on ASP.Net 4.0 MVC2. I plan to use Google's App Engine and Python to create a service to write to Big Table for storage. This may make me bring the front-end to python and Django also but it's my first time using the tech. If you wanna help out and this side of things I'm also interested in any input!

This project is about moving Web Development skills forward and I'm open to all input and possible directions.
