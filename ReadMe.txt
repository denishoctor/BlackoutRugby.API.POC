This is currently a simple Proof of Concept App for using the Blackout Rugby API. 

I'm keen for anyone who has an interest in Blackout Rugby and/or HTML5 and all that has come to encompass that term to get involved! 

Currently it's built on ASP.Net 4.0 MVC2. I plan to use Google's App Engine to create a service to write to Big Table for storage.
